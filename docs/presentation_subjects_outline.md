# Hyperlocal SkillSwap — Subjects Deck (with Speaker Notes)

## Slide 1 — Objectives / Goal
- Build a trusted, hyperlocal skill exchange network
- Enable fair, cashless exchanges via time credits
- Reduce friction: simple discovery, chat, and completion flow
- Strengthen community ties and increase access to help

Speaker notes:
- Frame success as more completed exchanges and stronger neighborhood ties.
- Emphasize low-friction UX and fairness through time-credit parity.

## Slide 2 — Problem Statement
- Hard to find affordable, trustworthy local help quickly
- Idle skills remain underutilized in neighborhoods
- Existing gig apps optimize for price, not reciprocity or community
- Informal groups (FB/Nextdoor) lack structure for reliable follow-through

Speaker notes:
- Use a relatable story: need quick help (e.g., tech support) but don’t want a costly, impersonal gig.
- Highlight fragmentation and unreliable fulfillment in informal communities.

## Slide 3 — Problem Solution
- Hyperlocal marketplace to match offered and needed skills
- Time credits: 1 hour earned = 1 hour to spend
- Structured flow: request → chat → confirm → complete → review
- Trust via proximity, profiles, and post-exchange reviews

Speaker notes:
- Explain the core mechanic: reciprocity through time credits, not cash.
- Keep the end-to-end journey clear and concise.

## Slide 4 — Market Analysis
- Audience: neighbors, students, retirees, creators; urban + campus clusters
- TAM/SAM/SOM: local services + community platforms; phased city rollouts
- Competitors: TaskRabbit, Nextdoor, Facebook Groups, timebanking orgs
- Differentiation: cashless reciprocity, hyperlocal matching, structured transactions

Speaker notes:
- Position against gig platforms (price-centric) and social groups (unstructured).
- Call out pilot geographies where density supports liquidity.

## Slide 5 — Business Model
- Value: fair exchanges, local trust, and access without cash
- Key partners: community orgs, campuses, coworking and maker spaces
- Channels: local ambassadors, partnerships, community events, social groups
- Cost structure: hosting, support/moderation, growth, community ops

Speaker notes:
- Lead with value proposition; then how we reach and serve users.
- Keep costs lightweight with SaaS infra and phased growth.

## Slide 6 — Start-up Plan
- Phase 1 (MVP): auth, profiles, skills, search, transactions, reviews
- Phase 2: notifications, saved searches, moderation tools, PWA
- Phase 3: Redis-backed realtime scale, community programs, badges
- Go-to-market: 1–2 pilot neighborhoods/campuses with ambassadors

Speaker notes:
- Tie phases to building liquidity and trust, not just features.
- Stress pilots to validate behavior loops and refine onboarding.

## Slide 7 — Revenue Generation
- Premium placement for offers/requests (non-intrusive)
- Community subscriptions (schools, HOAs, coworking) for admin tools
- Sponsored listings or local partner promotions
- Optional credit top-ups/donations; minimal/no ads to preserve trust

Speaker notes:
- Prioritize models aligned with community value and trust.
- Keep core exchanges free; monetize visibility and org features.

## Slide 8 — Conclusion
- Hyperlocal SkillSwap aligns incentives around reciprocity, not price
- Simple, structured flow lowers friction and builds trust
- Pilot-ready product with clear path to scale and monetization
- Ask: partners, pilot communities, and early ambassadors

Speaker notes:
- Recap the thesis in one sentence; restate the ask.
- Invite follow-ups and pilot collaborations.
